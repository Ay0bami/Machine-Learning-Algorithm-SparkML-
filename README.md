# Machine-Learning-Algorithm-SparkML-
Predicting Outcomes With Random Forest Analysis


The COVID19 pandemic has been devastating for hospitals as limited resources can be stretched. One of the works that is being investigated is the use of simulators that can determine the number of active cases likely to happen at a hospital.

The following is a dataset from the city of Toronto on COVID19 cases
https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/

Using the above dataset, we will write a SparkML machine learning algorithm in order to predict one of the
categories (for example fatality).
